\item Find the points on the line $x+y=4$ which lie at a unit distance from the line $4x+3y=10$.
\item Show that the tangent of an angle between the lines $\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1 \text{ and }\frac{x}{a}-\frac{y}{b}=1$ is $\frac{2ab}{a^2-b^2}$.

\item Find the equation of the line passing through the point of intersection of $2x+y=5\text{ and }x+3y+8=0$ and parallel the line $3x+4y=7$.
\item For what values of $a$ and $b$ the intercepts cut off on the coordinate axes by the line $ax+by+8=0$are equal in length but opposite in signs to those cut off by the line $2x-3y+=0$ on the axes.
\item If the intercept of a line between the coordinate axes is divided by the point (-5,4) in the ratio 1:2 then find the equation of the line.
\item Find the equation of a straight line on which length of perpendicular from the origin is four units and the line makes on angle of 120$\degree$ with the positive direction of $x$-axis. [\textbf{Hint} : Use normal form, here $\omega =30\degree$.]
\item Find the equation of one of the sides of an isosceles right angled triangle whose hypotenuse is given by $3x+4y=4$ and the opposite vertex of the hypotenuse is (2,2).
\end{enumerate}
 \textbf{Long Answer Type}
 \begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item If the equation of the base of an equilateral triangle is $x+y=2$ and the vertex is (2,-1), then find the length of the side of the triangle. 
[\textbf{Hint} : Find length of perpendicular ($p$) from (2,-1) to the line and use $p=l \sin 60degree$,where $l$ is the length of the triangle].
\item A variable line passes through a fixed point $\vec{P}$.The algebraic sum of the perpendiculars drawn from the points (2,0),(0,2) and (1,1) on the line is zero. Find the coordinates of the point $\vec{P}$.  
[\textbf{Hint} : let the slope of the line be $m$. Then the equation of the line passing through the fixed point $\vec{P}(x_1,y_1) y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$. Taking the algebraic sum of perpendicular distances equal to zero, we get $y-l=m(x-1)$. Thus $(x_1,y_1)$ is (1,1).]
\item In what direction should a line be drawn through the point (1,2) so that its point of intersection with line $x+y=4$ is at a distance $\sqrt{6}{3}$ from the given equilateral    
\item A straight line moves so that the sum of the reciprocals of its intercepts made on axes is constant. Show that the line passes through a fixed point. [\textbf{Hint} : $\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1\text{ where} \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\text{ constant }=\frac{1}{k}$(say). This implies that $\frac{k}{a}+\frac{k}{b}=1$ line passes through the fixed point $(k,k)$.]
\item Find the equation of the line which passes through the point (-4,3) and the portion of the line intercepted between the axes is divided internally in ratio 5:3 by this point.
\item Find the equations of the lines through the point of intersection of the line $x-y+1=0 \text{ and }2x-3y+5=0$ and whose distance from the point (3,2) is $\frac{7}{5}$.
\item If the sum of the distances of a moving point in a plane from the axes is $l$, then finds the locus of the point. [\textbf{Hint} :Given that $\abs{x}+\abs{y}=1$, which  gives four  sides of a square.] 
\item $\vec{P}_1,\vec{P}_2$ are points on either of the two lines $y-\sqrt{3}\abs{x}=2$ at a distance of 5 units from their point of intersection. Find the coordinates of the root of perpendiculars drawn from $P_1, P_2$ on the bisector of the angle between the given lines.
[\textbf{Hint} : Lines are $y=\sqrt{3}x+2 \text{ and }y=-\sqrt{3}x+2$ according as $x\geq0$ or $x0. y$-axis is the bisector of the angles between the lines. $P_1, P_2$ are the points on these lines at a distance of 5 units from the point of intersection of these lines which have a point on $y$-axis as a common foot of perpendiculars from these points. The $y$-coordinate of the foot of the perpendicular is given by 2=5 $\cos{30\degree}$.]
\item If $p$ is the length of perpendicular from the origin on the lien $\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1$ and $a^2,p^2,b^2$ are in A.P, then show that $a^4+b^4=0$.
